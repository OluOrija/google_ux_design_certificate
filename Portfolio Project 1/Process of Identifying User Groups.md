### **Document 2: Process of Identifying User Groups**  

---

#### **Step 1: Data Collection**  
- Conducted 15 semi-structured interviews (30–45 minutes each).  
- Recorded notes on demographics, goals, frustrations, and tech-savviness.  

#### **Step 2: Thematic Analysis**  
- **Group 1: Detail-Oriented Planners (Brides-to-Be)**  
  - **Shared Traits:** High need for customization, collaboration, and visual accuracy.  
  - **Quote:** “I need to tweak every petal until it’s perfect.”  
- **Group 2: Brand-Conscious Professionals (Business Owners)**  
  - **Shared Traits:** Focus on aesthetics, seasonal updates, and reliability.  
  - **Quote:** “My café’s vibe depends on florals—no room for errors.”  
- **Group 3: Time-Pressed Shoppers (Last-Minute Gifters)**  
  - **Shared Traits:** Prioritize speed, simplicity, and trust in outcomes.  
  - **Quote:** “I just want to click ‘send’ and know it’ll look great.”  

#### **Step 3: Validating Groups**  
- Cross-referenced interview notes to ensure groups were distinct:  
  - **Brides** vs. **Business Owners:** Differed in collaboration needs (family vs. brand alignment).  
  - **Gifters** vs. **Others:** Unique emphasis on speed over customization.  

#### **Step 4: Avoiding Bias**  
- Focused on **behaviors** (e.g., “needs real-time collaboration”) over stereotypes (e.g., “brides are picky”).  
- Included diverse demographics (e.g., male participants in the “gifters” group).

#### **Final User Groups**  
| **Group**                | **Key Needs**                          | **App Feature Alignment**               |  
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| Detail-Oriented Planners | Real-time previews, collaboration      | AR tools, shared design boards          |  
| Brand-Conscious Pros     | Seasonal consistency, reliability      | Pre-saved themes, vendor chat           |  
| Time-Pressed Shoppers    | Speed, simplicity                      | One-click templates, progress tracking  |

### **Next Steps**  
- Map each user group to specific app flows (e.g., “Gifters” → streamlined checkout).  
- Prioritize AR previews and in-app chat based on high demand across groups.  

This process ensures the app addresses real, diverse needs while minimizing bias.
