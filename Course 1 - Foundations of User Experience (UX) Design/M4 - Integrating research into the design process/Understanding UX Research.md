**Understanding UX Research**

UX (User Experience) research is a fundamental component of UX design. It ensures that product decisions are informed by real user needs, behaviors, and feedback, rather than assumptions. UX research plays a critical role throughout the *product development life cycle*, which consists of five stages: **brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch**.

### 1. **Foundational Research (Brainstorm Stage)**

* Conducted **before design begins** to understand user problems and inspire ideas.
* Helps create **personas** and **user stories**.
* Aims to answer: *What should we build? What are the user’s problems? How can we solve them?*
* Common methods:

  * **Interviews** – In-depth conversations to gather personal insights.
  * **Surveys** – Collect data from a broad audience.
  * **Focus Groups** – Group discussions to explore opinions and preferences.
  * **Competitive Audit** – Analyzing competitors to learn their strengths and weaknesses.
  * **Field Studies** – Observing users in their natural environment.
  * **Diary Studies** – Users track and report daily experiences over time.

### 2. **Design Research (Design Stage)**

* Conducted **while creating designs** to test and improve concepts.
* Helps answer: *How should we build it?*
* Aims to reduce risk and ensure usability.
* Common methods:

  * **Usability Studies** – Test prototypes with users to find pain points.
  * **A/B Testing** – Compare two design variations to find the more effective one.
  * **Cafe/Guerrilla Studies** – Quick feedback from random people in public settings.
  * **Card Sorting** – Understand how users categorize information.
  * **Intercepts** – Gather feedback during real-time user interaction in the field.

### 3. **Post-Launch Research (Post-Launch Stage)**

* Conducted **after product launch** to measure performance and user satisfaction.
* Answers: *Did we succeed?*
* Uses metrics like adoption, engagement, and satisfaction.
* Common methods:

  * **A/B Testing**
  * **Usability Studies**
  * **Surveys**
  * **Logs Analysis** – Review user behavior data from actual usage.

### Key Takeaway:

UX research is essential to build user-centered products. It should be conducted **before, during, and after** the design process. Entry-level designers must avoid relying solely on their assumptions and always prioritize research-backed decisions to ensure the product effectively meets user needs.
