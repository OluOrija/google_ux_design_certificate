**Understanding UX Research Methods – Summary**

UX research is essential to understanding users and making informed design decisions. To avoid assumptions about user needs, designers rely on **research**, which can be categorized by **who conducts it** and **the type of data collected**:

### **Research Categories**

1. **By Who Conducts It**:

   * **Primary Research**: Conducted directly by the designer (e.g., interviews, surveys, usability tests).
   * **Secondary Research**: Based on existing data from books, articles, or other external sources.

2. **By Type of Data**:

   * **Qualitative Research**: Observational, open-ended, focuses on understanding “why” and “how.”
   * **Quantitative Research**: Numerical, data-driven, answers questions like “how many” or “how much.”

Primary and secondary research can be either qualitative or quantitative.

### **Primary Research Methods**

#### **1. Interviews**

* One-on-one or group conversations to explore users' thoughts and feelings.
* Can be open-ended (qualitative) or close-ended (quantitative).
* **Pros**: In-depth understanding, real-time follow-ups, user-specific feedback.
* **Cons**: Time-consuming, costly, small sample sizes, group bias possible.

#### **2. Surveys**

* Standardized questions asked to many users, good for measuring trends.
* Supports both qualitative and quantitative formats.
* **Pros**: Large reach, fast insights, low cost, remote-friendly.
* **Cons**: Limited depth, less personalization, some questions unsuitable for survey format.

#### **3. Usability Studies**

* Observe users interacting with a product to identify design issues.
* Can be done in-person or online, often recorded.
* **Pros**: Real-time behavior insights, exposes design flaws, detailed feedback.
* **Cons**: Limited to usability, potentially costly, may not reflect real-world use.

### **Secondary Research**

* Uses pre-existing data to support or guide primary research.
* **Pros**: Inexpensive, quick, helps focus future studies, useful for early or supplemental research.
* **Cons**: No direct user feedback, not product-specific, risks overgeneralization.

### **Research in Practice**

A strong UX designer knows when and how to use each method. Combining primary and secondary research — as well as qualitative and quantitative data — leads to better, user-centered design decisions.
