Strategy - Understanding the Design Thinking Framework
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1 - Empathizing 

Goal
- What is the problem and why do we need the solution
- The goal of empathizing is to understand  users' problems, wants, needs, and situations in order to design a product that works for them and creates an enjoyable experience.

Empathizing process
- Questionnaires/surveys
- Interviews

Questionnaire and Interview questions should revolves around the following pillars (Empathy maps)
- Who excatly *are* the users and what are their situations?
- What do users *say* about their experiences with similar products?
- What do users *think* about their experiences?
- What do users *do* before, during, and after their experiences?
- What do users *feel* about their experiences?

User Personas
- Identify groups of similar users

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 2 - Define users' needs

Goal
- In the define phase of design thinking, designers build on their business requirements and empathy work to state a series of specific problems they want their design to address. These problems should emerge from a thorough understanding of who users are and how they experience the product, including the specific tasks they encounter and the feelings they bring to those tasks

User stories
- A one-sentence narrative told from a persona's perspective
- *Who* the user is
- *What* they want to do
- *Why* they want to so it
- Example: As *[type of user]*, I want to *[action]* so that *[benefit]*.

User journeys
- A user journey is a series of experiences that the user has as they try to achieve their goal.

Problem statements
- A problem statement summarizes *who* the user is, *what* they need from a design, and *why*. The following is a simple template for writing a problem statement:
*[Name of user persona]* is a *[type of user]* who needs *[type of user experience]* because *[benefits of user experience]*.
- This template is similar to a user story, but problem statements are typically more detailed, and they are written from the designer’s perspective.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 3 - Ideate Solutions

Goal
- The ideate phase is all about getting creative and brainstorming lots of potential solutions.

Ideation Techniques
- "How might we?" (HMW) questions : focuses on written questions and solutions
- Rapid Sketching (Crazy Eights) : focuses on visual approach 
    - divide a sheet of paper into eight squares
    - grab something to draw with
    - start an eight-minute timer
    - take one minute to sketch an idea or solution in each square/
    - When the eight-minutes timer goes off, there should be a differenct sketch in each of ther paper's eight squares.
- Competitive audits
    - What products do the competition offers?
    - What are those products' strengths and areas for improvement?
- SCAMPER
    - SCAMPER is a technique designers used to brainstorm changes and alternatives to ideas and designs.
    - Each letter of the acronym stands for a different action that designers can apply to their designs, such as substituting (S) elements for other elements, combining (C) elements into one, or adapting (A) elements with alternatives.
    - In full, the acronym stands for: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, and Rearrange. 

Collaboration
- Before launching a collaborative partnership or working session, effective designers or design teams typically ensure they’ve answered crucial questions such as:
    - Who will be involved? What will their roles be?
    - Where will the collaboration happen? Will it be in person or virtual?
    - Why is the collaboration happening? What is the end goal?
    - How will the collaboration happen? What tools and processes will we use?

Business Requirements
- Which of these ideas will be feasible within the project’s budget and schedule?
- Which of these ideas will best meet the standards for the design?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 4 - Prototype solutions

Goal
- In the prototype phase, UX designers will create a model of the product. To do this, they’ll use various practices such as:
    - Information architecture
    - Sitemaps
    - Wireframing (paper and digital)
    - Lo-fi prototypes
    - Hi-fi prototypes 
- The goal of prototyping is to have a model to test and gain feedback on. The prototyping and testing phases of design thinking work in tandem.

Information architecture and sitemaps
- When designers organize the information in a product, they create something called “information architecture,” or IA. Information architecture is essentially a high-level diagram or flowchart that shows how users can move through a product, like a website or an app.
- In planning a product’s information architecture, designers often create something called a sitemap, like this one for a website:
![alt text](samplesitemap.png)
- Like all good information architecture, this sitemap organizes the product by outlining its hierarchy and sequence:
    - Hierarchy refers to how topics are prioritized and subordinated. Hierarchies emphasize topics that are broader or more important, which in turn contain smaller or less important topics. In the sitemap above, for example, “Shop” is a major topic that contains smaller topics, like “Denim/Pants.”
    - Sequence refers to the order in which users can navigate through the product’s hierarchy, like navigating from the “Homepage” to “Shop” to “Denim/Pants” and so on.

Wireframing
- Wireframes are rough sketches of the product that bring the sitemap to life.
- There are two methods designers can employ:
    - Paper wireframes - Paper wireframes are sketches on paper. 
    - Digital wireframes - Digital wireframes are developed in a UX design tool such as Figma or Adobe XD.

Low fidelity (lo-fi) prototypes
- In UX, “fidelity” means how closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product.
- A low fidelity prototype is a simple interactive model that provides a basic idea of what the product will look like and how its components will flow for users.
- Designers often create lo-fi prototypes by assembling their wireframes and adding interactivity, or the ability to navigate from one screen to another. 
- Designers use lo-fi prototypes to test and improve their designs before spending time and effort developing more detailed high-fidelity prototypes.

High fidelity (hi-fi) prototypes
- A high fidelity prototype takes the lo-fi prototype and brings it as close to the final product as possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 5 - Test solutions

Goal
- In the test phase, the goal is to refine the prototype as designers gain insight into whether or not it solves the defined problem. Once the testing is done, the prototype will be finalized, and the prototype will move on to the developers, who will turn the design into the actual product.

Plan
- Who will participate in the tests? - ideal participants include real-life users who align with the project’s user personas.
- What types of tests will be conducted?
- When and where will the tests be conducted? - Balancing act between the designers needs and the project's business reuirements
- Why are the tests conducted? 
    - Validate ideas, information, or decisions from other parts of the design thinking process
    - Uncover usability issues
- How will participants engage with the prototype?
- How will information be collected?
