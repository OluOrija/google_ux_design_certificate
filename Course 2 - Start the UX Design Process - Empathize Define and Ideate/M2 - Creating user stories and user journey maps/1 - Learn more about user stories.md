# 📘 Summary: Creating Effective User Stories

You’ve already learned how **empathy maps** and **personas** help you understand your users. Another essential tool in UX design is the **user story**, which builds on that understanding by capturing a user's goal from their perspective.

## 🧾 What Is a User Story?

A **user story** is a **one-sentence fictional narrative** told from the user's point of view. It captures:

* **Who** the user is
* **What** they want to do
* **Why** they want to do it

### 📌 User Story Template:

```
As a [type of user], I want to [action], so that [benefit].
```

This format ensures clarity and focus on user needs, guiding design decisions and serving as a checklist during development.

## ✅ Best Practices

* Keep user stories **short**, **impactful**, and **clear**
* Focus on a specific **action** and **benefit**
* Use them to **inspire features** and solve **real user problems**
* Practice **empathy** to tailor solutions to unique user needs
