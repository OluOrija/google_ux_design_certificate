Hereâ€™s a **concise summary** of the provided content, organized for clarity and usefulness during the **Define phase** of the Design Thinking process:

## ðŸ§­ Introduction to the Define Phase

After empathizing with users through interviews, personas, user stories, and journey maps, UX designers move into the **Define phase** of Design Thinking. The goal here is to **clarify and articulate the core user problems** that need solving.

---

## ðŸ§© Key Components of the Define Phase

### 1. **Problem Statements**

Problem statements distill empathy research into a **clear, human-centered need**.

**Template:**

```
[User name] is a/an [user characteristics] who needs [user need] because [insight].
```

**Example:**

> Arnold is a busy executive who needs an easy app experience to hire a dog walker because he's not technologically savvy.

#### Characteristics of strong problem statements:

* **Human-centered**
* **Broad enough** for creative exploration
* **Narrow enough** to be actionable and solvable

---

### 2. **Hypothesis Statements**

These are **educated guesses** about how a design might solve the userâ€™s problem.

**Templates:**

* **If/then format:**
  *If \[user] can \[action], then they will \[benefit].*

* **We believe format:**
  *We believe that \[action] will help \[user] achieve \[goal].*

**Example:**

> If Arnold can use a simplified version of the dog walker app, then he will be able to hire a walker efficiently.

---

### 3. **Value Propositions**

Value propositions **communicate the unique benefit** your solution offers. They synthesize multiple hypotheses and answer two key questions:

* **What does the product do?**
* **Why should the user care?**

**Example:**

> The bakeryâ€™s new website mimics the feel of a friendly phone call, enabling visually impaired users to place online orders easily and feel connected to staff.

## ðŸ”Ž Discovering & Defining Pain Points

Pain points are **user frustrations** that prevent goal completion. They fall into four categories:

* **Financial**
* **Product-related**
* **Process-related**
* **Support-related**

Use the **5 Ws and H** to explore pain points:

* **Who** is experiencing it?
* **What** is the problem?
* **When** does it occur?
* **Where** does it happen?
* **Why** is it important?
* **How** does the user currently try to solve it?

## ðŸ’¡ Applying to UX Projects

### Problem & Hypothesis Pair Example:

* **Problem:**
  *Ali is a remote student who needs to order coffee from their seat because they donâ€™t want to lose their table.*

* **Hypothesis:**
  *If Ali uses the CoffeeHouse app to order from their seat, then an employee can deliver it and Ali wonâ€™t lose their table.*

---

## âœ… Key Takeaways

* The **Define phase** translates research into **clear, actionable problems**.
* **Problem statements** help align teams and set goals.
* **Hypothesis statements** guide solution exploration.
* **Value propositions** articulate the benefit to users and stakeholders.
* Always **empathize**, avoid assumptions, and **validate with users**.
* Strong problem/hypothesis statements make your portfolio stand out in UX job applications.
