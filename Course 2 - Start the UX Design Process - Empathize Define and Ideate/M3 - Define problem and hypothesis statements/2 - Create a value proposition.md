## 🌟 **Determining a Value Proposition**

### 🔍 What Is a Value Proposition?

A **value proposition** is a **clear, compelling statement** that explains why a user should choose your product. It defines:

* **What** your product does
* **Why** users should care

It’s the answer to:

> *“Why should I use this?”*

### 💼 **Example: Gmail**

When Gmail launched in 2004, it stood out with unique offerings:

* **Email conversation views**
* **1 GB of cloud storage** (way more than competitors)

These features became Gmail’s **unique value propositions**.

### 🛠️ **How to Build a Value Proposition**

#### ✅ Step 1: List All Features & Benefits

Brainstorm everything your product offers — no matter how small.

#### ✅ Step 2: Categorize What Adds Real Value

Sort those features into categories that **reflect user needs** (e.g., accessibility, professionalism, cost, reliability).

Remove features that don’t solve real user problems.

#### ✅ Step 3: Match Features to Personas

Link each meaningful feature with a **persona’s specific pain point**.
Example (from a dog walker app):

* **Arnold (tech novice):** Easy-to-use design
* **Jessica (safety-focused):** Geo-tracking for walkers

#### ✅ Step 4: Finalize Your List

Keep only the features that match real needs. These become your **product’s value propositions**.

---

### 💎 **Identify What’s Unique**

To stand out, figure out which value propositions **competitors do NOT offer**.
Research reviews and customer complaints to find unmet needs you can fulfill.

> **Example:** If competitors lack well-trained, reliable dog walkers, that becomes your **unique value proposition**.

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

* Value propositions should be **short, clear, and user-centered**.
* They highlight what **solves user pain points** and what makes your product **better than alternatives**.

  > *“I have to have this!”*
