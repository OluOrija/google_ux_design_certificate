**Empathy in UX Design:**
Empathy is essential in UX design—it helps designers understand users’ needs and challenges. Designers often begin empathizing with users before conducting formal interviews, using *empathy exercises* with fictional *user profiles* (short bios representing potential users) to anticipate needs and improve their interview questions.

**Empathy vs. Personas:**

* **User profiles** are informal, fictional bios used in empathy exercises.
* **User personas** are formal, data-driven representations based on multiple interviews.

**Example – Reena’s Profile:**
Reena is a paramedic with a busy, shifting schedule and dyslexia, making quick reading difficult. The designer uses empathy to imagine Reena’s responses to interview questions and refines questions to be more sensitive and effective.

**Refining Interview Questions:**
The designer revises leading or emotionally charged questions (e.g., using “challenges”) to be more neutral and user-friendly, while still allowing room to explore difficulties if raised naturally by the participant.

**Conducting Empathy Exercises:**

* Choose fictional user profiles.
* Imagine how each might respond to interview questions.
* Use this to refine interview goals, identify user needs, and think of design solutions.
* Optional: Interview real users instead using platforms like UserTesting or User Interviews.

**Analyzing Empathy Data:**

* Look for patterns across user responses.
* Identify common problems and potential features to solve them.
* Tailor your design to suit a broad range of users.

**Key Takeaway:**
Empathy is not just for interviews—it’s a continuous tool for improving every stage of UX design, from research planning to feature development. Pre-interview empathy exercises help validate interview questions and generate design ideas rooted in user reality.
