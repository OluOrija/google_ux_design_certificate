**Summary:**

Empathizing with users through interviews is a core part of UX design. While interviewing real users is optional during training, understanding how to find and recruit participants is essential for real-world UX research.

### **1. Screener Surveys**

To find suitable participants, UX designers use **screener surveys**—questionnaires that assess if potential participants match the study’s **target audience** based on characteristics like:

* Age
* Location
* Job/industry
* Gender

These surveys should be **respectful and inclusive**, especially when asking for sensitive demographic information. Make such questions optional and explain why you're collecting the data (e.g., to support inclusive design).

### **2. Representative Samples**

Aim to recruit a **diverse and representative sample** that reflects the larger user population. This helps ensure the product is **equitable and accessible** to all users, especially groups often underrepresented in research. Although this may require more time and resources, it's a key practice in professional UX work.

### **3. Recruitment Methods**

How you recruit participants depends on your resources and context. Common methods include:

* **Personal network**: Ask friends, family, or colleagues who match your target user profile.
* **Existing user base**: Recruit from a company’s current users.
* **Online platforms**: Use social media or websites like *UserTesting* and *User Interviews*.
* **Online communities**: Post in relevant groups (e.g., parenting forums for a parenting app), but always check the group’s rules first.
* **Hallway testing**: Ask people in person in relevant locations (e.g., coffee shops), though this may not yield fully representative feedback.
* **Recruiting agencies**: If budget allows, third-party agencies can help you find qualified and diverse participants efficiently.

### **Key Takeaway**

Successful UX research starts with recruiting the right participants. Use screener surveys to find a diverse group that aligns with your product’s users, and choose a recruitment method that fits your project’s scope and resources.
