**Summary:**

Empathy is a core skill in UX design, enabling designers to understand and connect with users’ thoughts and feelings to create better experiences. Unlike sympathy, which expresses concern without shared emotion, empathy involves truly feeling and understanding what the user goes through.

To build empathy, UX designers should:

1. **Ask thoughtful questions** to uncover user needs.
2. **Observe user behavior** for non-verbal cues.
3. **Practice active listening** to fully grasp user feedback.
4. **Seek diverse input** to avoid biased responses.
5. **Keep an open mind** and set aside personal biases.
6. **Stay updated on UX research** to understand evolving user behaviors.

By deeply empathizing with users, designers can anticipate needs, build stronger connections, and create more impactful, user-centered products—reducing the need for major revisions later in the design process.
