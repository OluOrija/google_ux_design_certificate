### **1. Prepare for the Interview**

* **Write a script** of consistent interview questions, but feel free to explore deeper if needed.
* **Gather supplies** like a computer, list of questions, and note-taking tools.

### **2. Meet the Participant**

* **Build rapport** through friendly small talk to make users comfortable.
* **Thank them** for their time and willingness to participate.

* **Ask open-ended questions** starting with "why" to encourage detailed responses.
* Follow up on short answers to gain deeper insights.

### **4. Take Notes**
