**Summary:**

To conduct effective user interviews in UX design, it's important to set clear **research goals**, define **participant characteristics**, and write thoughtful **interview questions**. This process helps designers empathize with users and gather valuable insights to guide product design.

### 1. **Research Goals**

Designers create focused, user-centered goals that:

* Address users’ challenges, behaviors, and emotions.
* Identify pain points and frustrations related to the product.
* Inform design decisions based on real user needs.

**Example goals (Zia’s Pizza app):**

* Understand challenges with busy schedules and meal planning.
* Identify frustrations when ordering from restaurants.

### 2. **Participant Characteristics**

Effective interviewees are representative of the target audience. Designers aim for a manageable yet diverse group, considering traits such as:

* Age, location, gender, and disability status.
* Frequency of product use (e.g., weekly food ordering).

**Example participants:**

* Aged 18–62, living in urban/suburban areas, with diverse backgrounds and experiences.

### 3. **Interview Questions**

Good questions are:

* **Relevant** to the problem.
* **Open-ended** to encourage elaboration.
* **Clear** and easy to understand.
* **Neutral** to avoid bias.
* **Designed for follow-up**, allowing deeper exploration.

**Example question:**

* “What challenges do you face in the ordering process? How do these challenges make you feel?”

### **Key Takeaway**

Careful planning of goals, participants, and questions sets the foundation for effective UX interviews. This enables designers to empathize, gather meaningful insights, and build products that truly meet user needs.
